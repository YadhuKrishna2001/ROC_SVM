# ROC_SVM
Receiver Operating Machine
The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a classifier as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is created by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The TPR is also known as sensitivity or recall, while the FPR is defined as 1 - specificity. The curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity
